# 5 Stage Pipelined Datapath
**Work in Progress**

This was my final project for Advanced Computer Organization. We were given a set of 16-bit-MIPS instructions and were asked to design a pipelined datapath that would be able to execute all of the instructions. The project handout can be found at:

This was assigned to us in groups of two. I ended up coding each individual component module as well as most of the CPU and CPU_test_fixture file. I did most of the coding for fun during my free time as I found it really interesting writing code to simulate hardware and write testbenches for each component to show they worked. My partner helped with the debuging and wrote the report.
